# Image Reconstruction Challenge

Welcome to the Image Reconstruction Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

### Challenge Description:
We have a set of cropped images, each of size **224x224 pixels**, but we don't know their original positions! Your challenge is to **reconstruct the original image** using computer vision techniques.

### Dataset:
Download the dataset from the `dataset` folder. The dataset contains multiple cropped images that need to be stitched together.

### What You'll Need:
- Python (3.6+)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for sharing your solution)
- Any additional libraries you may want to use (e.g., SIFT, ORB)

### How to Approach:
1. **Download the dataset** from this repository.
2. Use feature matching (e.g., ORB, SIFT) to align and stitch the images together.
3. **Share your solution using a Jupyter Notebook** for detailed explanations, visualizations, and code snippets.

### Why Jupyter Notebooks?
Jupyter Notebooks allow you to combine code, explanations, and visualizations in a single document. This is a great way to showcase your approach, display intermediate results, and explain your thought process. You can:
- Explain the logic behind each step.
- Show key parts of your code.
- Visualize the reconstruction process with images.

To run the notebook:
```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
